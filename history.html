    <h2>History of Version Control Systems</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><i>1972: </i><b>Source Code Control System (SCCS)</b> – one of the first version control systems, developed
at Bell Labs, which introduced the basic idea of tracking changes.</li>
        <li><i>1982: </i><b>Revision Control System (RCS)</b> – released by Walter Tichy at Purdue University, RCS
automated change tracking for individual files using delta storage (storing differences between
file versions). RCS was a local VCS (no network support), handling one file at a time.</li>
        <li><i>1986: </i><b>Concurrent Versions System (CVS)</b> – developed by Dick Grune as a front-end to RCS, CVS
allowed collaboration on whole projects with a client-server model . It added networked
repositories and concurrent multi-developer capabilities to RCS.</li>
        <li><i>2000: </i><b>Subversion (SVN)</b> – created by CollabNet as a successor to CVS, Subversion improved on
CVS’s weaknesses. SVN introduced atomic commits (all-or-nothing changesets), better handling
of file renames, and more efficient network operations. By ~2006, SVN had become one of the
most popular VCS tools, addressing many of CVS’s shortcomings. SVN was still
centralized: a single repository stored the code, and developers committed to that central server.</li>
        <li><i>2005: </i><b>Git and Mercurial</b> – a breakthrough year for version control. In 2005, after the Linux
kernel’s commercial VCS (BitKeeper) license was revoked, Linus Torvalds created Git as a new
distributed VCS for the kernel . Around the same time, Matt Mackall released Mercurial. Both
Git and Mercurial are distributed version control systems (DVCS), meaning every user has a
full copy of the repository.</li>
        <li><i>2008: </i><b>GitHub launched</b> – GitHub provided a web-based collaboration platform on top of Git. It
made sharing code and participating in projects easier with features like pull requests, issue
tracking, and social networking for developers. GitHub greatly accelerated Git’s adoption across the industry.</li>
        <li><i>2010s: </i><b>Wide adoption of Git and migration from older systems</b> – Throughout the 2010s, many
teams and open-source projects migrated from CVS, SVN, or other tools to Git. Even companies
that had used centralized systems (like Microsoft’s TFS or Perforce) moved toward Git-based
workflows. Distributed version control became the new standard for most software
development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Centralized vs. Distributed Version Control</h2>
   <p>Centralized systems are simple and good for a single source of truth, but suffer from
single-point failures and require connectivity for most operations. Distributed systems add complexity
in exchange for greater flexibility, offline work, and resilience – these have become dominant in modern
development. Many projects that started on CVCS (like Subversion) eventually migrated to DVCS
(like Git) to take advantage of these benefits.</p>
